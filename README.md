# weatherDashboard

In this project, we used third-party weather APIs to fetch weather data and display it. We needed to use multiple dynamic URLs to fetch the coordinates of the input cities as well. I had a lot of fun with the css and the event listeners. It was challenging to get the second event listener for the history buttons. Overall, a fun project that has a lot of use!
